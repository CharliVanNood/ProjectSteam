Overview
This project consists of two main Python scripts: connectToServer.py and httpTest.py. 
The connectToServer.py script is responsible for reading sensor data and sending it to a web server,.

Files
connectToServer.py
This script connects to a WiFi network, reads data from a distance sensor and a temperature sensor, and sends the data to a specified web server.

Classes:
DistSensor: Handles the distance sensor.

Functions:
conn(ssid, password, max_wait=10): 
    ssid = your network ssid
    password = your network password
    max_wait = a specified max number of seconds the program has to connect to the network defaulted to 10

    Connects to the WiFi network.

calculate_temperature(): 
    Reads and calculates the temperature from the sensor on adc(4).

send(data): 
    data = the specified data to send

    Sends the sensor data to the web server.

Main Loop: Continuously reads sensor data and sends it to the web server.

Usage
Replace the ssid and password variables with your WiFi credentials.
Replace the url variable with the IP address of your web server.
Run the script to start sending sensor data to the web server.


------------------this will probably be deleted later----------------
The httpTest.py script serves as a web server to receive and display the sensor data for testing purposes.

Run the script to start the Flask web server.
The server will be accessible at http://0.0.0.0:8080.
The web page will display the latest sensor data received.
